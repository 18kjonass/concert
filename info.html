    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p> AJR play live at 3Olympia Theatre this September

        Three brothers form a band, they write, produce, and record music in their living room, and they end up
        unlocking a magical world unlike anything else out there. Those brothers comprise multiplatinum indie pop trio
        AJR, and that world opens up like never before on their fourth full-length album, OK ORCHESTRA [S-Curve/BMG].
        Brushstrokes of intricate alternative rock, hummable pop, and Broadway bombast bring this place to life in
        technicolor as the band—Adam [bass, vocals], Jack [vocals, guitar], and Ryan [ukulele, piano, vocals]—amplify
        every element of their sound.

        Catch them live at Dublin's 3Olympia Theatre this September.</p>
